I am passionate about Software Development, particularly \n              Mobile and Web Development. Through software engineering courses I've created three Android Apps that are on display on the Personal Projects Tab. In addition\n              to this I am learning React and Javascript concurrently, in fact this website was developed from scratch using React. I hope to develop more software in the \n              future that I can share with you all, but in the meantime I hope you enjoy my currently existing projects. \n            </p>\n            <SocialIcon \n              url=\"https://github.com/shaneilk\" \n              style={{\n                margin: '5px 5px 5px 5px',\n                height: 90, width: 90\n              }}\n            />\n            <SocialIcon \n              url=\"https://linkedin.com/in/shaneil-kapadia\" \n              style={{\n                margin: '5px 5px 5px 5px',\n                height: 90, width: 90\n              }}\n            />\n          </div> \n        </div>\n      </Tabs>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","/home/shaneilk/dev/my-website/src/reportWebVitals.js",[],"/home/shaneilk/dev/my-website/src/components/Tabs.js",[],"/home/shaneilk/dev/my-website/src/components/Tab.js",[],["37","38"],"/home/shaneilk/dev/my-website/src/components/FivePhotoAppLayout.js",["39"],"import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\n\n\nconst FivePhotoAppLayout = (props) => {\n    return(\n        <div>\n            <h2 style={{ fontFamily: 'Times New Roman' }}>\n                {props.AppName}\n                <br></br>\n                {props.Technologies}\n            </h2>\n            <p style={{fontFamily: 'Times New Roman'}}>\n                \n                {props.Description}\n                \n                \n            </p>\n            <div href=\"/\" className=\"avatar\">\n                <img alt=\"avatar\" src={props.photo1}\n                    width=\"500\"\n                    height=\"250\"\n                    style={{ margin: '10px 10px 10px 10px' }}\n                />\n                <img alt=\"avatar\" src={props.photo2}\n                    width=\"500\"\n                    height=\"250\"\n                    style={{ margin: '10px 10px 10px 10px' }}\n                />\n                <img alt=\"avatar\" src={props.photo3}\n                    width=\"500\"\n                    height=\"250\"\n                    style={{ margin: '10px 10px 10px 10px' }}\n                />\n                <img alt=\"avatar\" src={props.photo4}\n                    width=\"500\"\n                    height=\"250\"\n                    style={{ margin: '10px 10px 10px 10px' }}\n                />\n                <img alt=\"avatar\" src={props.photo5}\n                    width=\"500\"\n                    height=\"250\"\n                    style={{ margin: '10px 10px 10px 10px' }}\n                />\n            </div>\n        </div>        \n    );\n}\n\nexport default FivePhotoAppLayout;","/home/shaneilk/dev/my-website/src/components/VideoPlayerLayout.js",[],{"ruleId":"40","replacedBy":"41"},{"ruleId":"42","replacedBy":"43"},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"45","line":3,"column":8,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":3,"endColumn":19},{"ruleId":"40","replacedBy":"48"},{"ruleId":"42","replacedBy":"49"},{"ruleId":"44","severity":1,"message":"50","line":2,"column":8,"nodeType":"46","messageId":"47","endLine":2,"endColumn":16},"no-native-reassign",["51"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["52"],"no-unused-vars","'ReactPlayer' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar",["51"],["52"],"'ReactDOM' is defined but never used.","no-global-assign","no-unsafe-negation"]
